    <p> Born as a series of releases between tours, the Outworld Music EPs were meant to be outlets for musical experiments with different styles without departing so much from Ritualz's sound that it could turn into a side project. Planned to be 4 chapters long, these individually themed releases would eventually become part of a larger concept that came to be during two years of travels. </p>

    <p>Outworld Music is a journey that starts with the exploration of human emotions and following primitive human nature turns to the occult and mystic in search of a deeper meaning to existence. Not content with relying on the credence of higher powers it leads into the exploration of our relationship with nature and the conclusion that all things eventually arrive at the inevitable and absolute: Death. </p>

    <p> Man, Myth, Nature, Death. </p>

    <p>This is the end.</p>

    <p>Outworld Music is out now digitally and <a href="http://ritualz.bigcartel.com/product/outworld-music-digipak" target="_blank">physically on CD</a>.</p>
